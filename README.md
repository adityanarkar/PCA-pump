# PCA-pump

This arduino code drives NEMA17 bipolar stepper motor using A4988 driver.

Interfacing of A4988 driver with NEMA17 bipolar stepper motor is done by following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CmjB4WF5XA).

The same code can be used to drive the bipolar stepper motor of PCA pump.

Uploaded image shows the connection of A4988 driver to the bipolar stepper motor of a PCA pump.

A4988 requires 8V-35V power supply (to VMOT) to drive the motor. Based on previous experiments, it is advisable to use at least 16+V power supply to drive the stepper motor efficiently.
